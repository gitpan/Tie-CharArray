  Tie::CharArray -- version 0.02

This module provides a way to manipulate Perl strings through tied
arrays.  The operations are implemented in terms of substr(), pack()
and other string manipulation functions, but the programmer normally
need not be aware of this.  As Perl has no primitive character type,
two alternative representations are provided:

  * Strings as arrays of single-character strings
  * Strings as arrays of small integers

To install, just do:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

No tests are included for this version.  This modules requires perl
5.005 and the standard module Tie::Array.
