  Tie::CharArray -- version 1.00

This module provides a way to manipulate Perl strings through tied
arrays.  The operations are implemented in terms of substr(), pack()
and other string manipulation functions, but the programmer normally
need not be aware of this.  As Perl has no primitive character type,
two alternative representations are provided:

  * Strings as arrays of single-character strings
  * Strings as arrays of small integers

As of 1.00, two exportable functions are also provided for those who
wish to avoid using tie() directly.

To install, just do:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This module requires perl 5.005 or above.
